## ⚡ Quick Start

2.  **Open** the project folder.
3.  **Launch** `index.html` or `index2.html` directly in your web browser.

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors
The site primarily uses Tailwind's color palette (Indigo, Slate, Rose, Emerald). You can customize the look by:
1.  Modifying the `colors` object in the `<script>` sections of the HTML files (for Charts).
2.  Updating the Tailwind class names in the HTML (e.g., changing `bg-indigo-600` to `bg-blue-600`).
3.  Editing custom styles in `style.css`.

### Adding/Removing Pages
*   To add a link to the navigation, update the `<nav>` section in all HTML files.
*   The `main.js` file contains shared logic; ensure it is included in any new page you create.

## 📱 Dashboards

### User Dashboard (`user_dashboard.html`)
*   **Overview**: Quick stats on views and inquiries.
*   **My Listings**: Manage active, pending, and sold items.
*   **Wallet**: View balance and transaction history.
*   **Messages**: fully styled chat interface.

### Admin Dashboard (`admin_dashboard.html`)
*   **Analytics**: Comprehensive charts for traffic and revenue.
*   **User Management**: Tables for managing registered users.
*   **Moderation**: Tools to approve or reject listings.
